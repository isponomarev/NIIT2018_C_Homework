You guys like that song, don't ya?
Sure, if you play it right
So you guys are tired, huh? (no)
We're just getting warmed up and you guys are tired
You're ready to go home (no)
You guys sound tired to me (no)
Let's hear you say "Fuck no James!" (fuck no James)
Alright, so we want some more
So we're going to give you a little test here man
I start it, you finish it we'll find out what you've got left
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
ehhh I hope that ain't it
Oh yeah (oh yeah), Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Master (master), of (of), puppets!

End of passion play, crumbling away
(I'm your source of self-destruction)
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
(Leading on your deaths' construction)

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Obey your master
(Master)

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
(Master)
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
(Master), yeah

Needlework the way, never you betray
(Life of death becoming clearer)
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
(Chop your breakfast on a mirror)

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm fucking you

Obey your master
(Master)

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your fucking dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
(Master)
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
(Master)
